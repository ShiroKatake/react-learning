# Introduction

I'm currently a 4th year student studying a double major in comp sci and game design, and soon I'll need to find myself an internship.

As of right now, doing game dev doesn't seem like the best choice for my long term career, so I'm considering web dev as another option I can go down.

I've just applied for a web dev internship, and I realized React.js is a popular framework that a lot of places use in their work, yet I don't know anything about it. All this time I've only been building web apps "raw", and it seems so inefficient now that I've got exposed to the kind of stuffs React can do.

So, I'm doing this partly because I wanna prepare myself for the web dev internship in case I do get it, but I also wanna expand my skills and knowledge as a web dev in general.

And so, this is the start of my React.js learning journey. From here down will be a log of questions, answers and discoveries that I've noted down along the way.

# Study Log

## **Lesson 1: Installing React**

### **Resources:**

- [Traversy Media: React JS Crash Course 2021](https://youtu.be/w7ejDZ8SWv8?t=757)
- [MOSH: React JS - React Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/Ke90Tje7VS0?t=348)

### **Notes:**

- This is done via command prompt.
- The videos I watched recommended to install it in the project folder, not in like `C:/Programs` or anything "global"
  - This makes it seems like the installing process needs to be repeated for every new project.
  - This is less than ideal for me since I'll be making _many_ web apps, which might turn into many separate projects.

### **Questions:**

:question: **Q1**: Can I just make a "default" project with this installed and just copy pasta every time I make a new project? It seems faster that way, but I guess the downside is it won't be 100% up to date every time I make a new project.

:question: **Q2**: What about putting every React-based projects inside a "master" folder called something like `React Web Apps`? Might not work in a professional environment where each project needs to be separate, but it might work for my purpose.
