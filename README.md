I'm currently a 4th year student studying a double major in comp sci and game design, and soon I'll need to find myself an internship.

As of right now, doing game dev doesn't seem like the best choice for my long term career, so I'm considering web dev as another option I can go down.

I've just applied for a web dev internship, and I realized React.js is a popular framework that a lot of places use in their work, yet I don't know anything about it. All this time I've only been building web apps "raw", and it seems so inefficient now that I've got exposed to the kind of stuffs React can do.

So, I'm doing this partly because I wanna prepare myself for the web dev internship in case I do get it, but I also wanna expand my skills and knowledge as a web dev in general.

And so, this is the start of my React.js learning journey.
